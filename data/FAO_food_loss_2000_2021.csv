Mould damage is regarded by local farmers as more of an inconvenience than a loss , since all the grain will be used for food or for brewing after washing to remove visible',","A loss assessment survey was conducted in the major cereal and pulse crop producing  areas of Arrillara, Oromiya and Southern Regions. Cereal production was adversely  affected by an unusual rainfall pattern this season. Shortage of rain during the  growing period resulted in some crop failure or reduced yields, and heavy  unseasonable rai11 at crop matw-ity led to problems at harvest &J.d fw-ther crop losses.  This had implications for the loss assessment exercise. In selecting sample areas,  consideration had to be given to identifying those that were less severely affected and  where grain was expected to be stored for several months, as well as trying to ensure  reasonable coverage ofthe crops under study.  Group and individual farmer interviews were conducted at the start, to identify postharvest constraints and to assess their importance in relation to the constraints in the  total agricultural system. Insect infestation in storage was identified as an important  problem. A common coping strategy is for farmers to sell grain early in order to  avoid high losses and then to buy grain later as required. Pressure to fmd cash (to pay  taxes and loans) as well as the fear of insect infestation during storage were the main  reasons given by farmers for selling grain soon after harvest. Early sales at low prices  removes an opportunity for farmers to add value to their production by selling at  higher prices later in the season or for increasing household food security through  retention of more grain on the farm.  Farmers' stores were sampled on two occasions, first within the first month of storage  and again later in the season. Questionnaires were used to collect information on the  history of the grain, details of storage methods and patterns of removal and grain use.  Samples were analysed to determine loss caused by insects and mould damage using a  'count and weigh' technique, but also taking account of farmers' practices in dealing  with damaged grain. The loss recorded in samples was related to the pattern of grain  use to derive a cumulative figure of loss over the season.",Survey,"Boxall, Robin (1998)","Boxall, Robin (1998)","Boxall, Robin (1998)"

The reduction in the weight could also be due to moisture  losses from the grains during storage as well as pest and  insect infestations.,"The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the  Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between  2009 and 2010.  Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.  Experimental design  A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica  2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining  harvesting losses. The experimental design for milling yield was 2 x  3 CRD comprising 2 varieties and 3 milling machines.",Controlled Experiment,"Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K.

288,Ghana,,113,Rice,2011,32.855,13.01 -52.7%,,Milling,Processing,,"The results of the milling analysis have been presented in  Table 6. The results showed that SB30 had marginally  higher milling yield (67.32%) than SB10 (66%).  However, the differences between the milling yields of  either the SB30 machine and the locally manufactured  milling machine or that of the SB10 machine and the  locally manufactured milling machine were significant.  The locally manufactured milling machine had the lowest  milling yield (63.33%). This implies that the locally  manufactured milling machine was less efficient as it also  resulted in higher percentage (52.7%) of broken grains  (Table 6). This implies that the local machine produced  less white rice per unit weight of paddy. This resulted in  less recoverable rice and therefore less revenue. SB30 is therefore superior to both SB10 and the Local machine in  terms of milling yield. In spite of the higher milling yield of  SB30, it is still lower than the 67.5% (2010 data)  considered to the lowest on record in the USA (Robinson,  2010). According to the author, this could lead to a shift  to selling more broken grains, consequently mean lower  prices. Norman and Otoo (2003) recommended that  improved dehulling and whitening machines should be  developed and tested for use in rice processing","Table 7.

Weight losses during storage losses of Nerica 1 and Nerica 2.      The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the  Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between  2009 and 2010.  Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.  Experimental design  A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica  2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining  harvesting losses. The experimental design for milling yield was 2 x  3 CRD comprising 2 varieties and 3 milling machines.",Controlled Experiment,"Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K.

Total losses due to  only harvesting and threshing losses at farmer’s fields  ranged between 5.60 and 16.14%. The differences in  postharvest losses among the farmers were due to  different level of skill of harvesting and threshing as well  as poor weed control. During the study it was observed  that the farmers’ fields were engulfed in a lot of weeds.  Poor weed control is known to interfere with effectiveness  of harvesting (Al-Khatib, 1995).",5,Case Study,"Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K.

The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the  Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between  2009 and 2010.  Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.

The placement of wrapped bananas on motorbikes and trucks caused physical injuries which affected the fingers on the outer row of the hands. After ripening the bruised area becomes hardened and creates avenues for entry of pathogens. Since bananas are climacteric, injury to the fruit causes ethylene production, increases respiration and water loss thereby shortening postharvest life.

Usually, no collective bargaining takes place on the price because each  farmer interacts individually with traders (brokers) and as a result, traders take advantage of  farmers by colluding to buy mangoes at prices lower than the prevailing market prices. This  exploitative tendency by buyers who offer very low prices was mentioned by 94 percent of farmers  as the major marketing challenge followed by delayed purchase after harvest (64%). This occurs  when brokers instruct farmers to harvest the mangoes promising to pick them up the next day but   41  then intentionally delay to do so. They then persuade farmers to sell their produce at lower prices  to avoid additional spoilage and loss given that mangoes are highly perishable. On-farm sorting,  grading and bulking of mango fruit is a common practice and is usually done by traders (brokers)  before buying them. They bring their own workers to the farm to harvest the fruit or by giving a  purchasing future date thus advising farmers on when to harvest. In both cases, the buyer meets the  labour costs involved. After sorting, damaged mangoes are rejected by buyers and farmers usually  have to find alternative use or ways to dispose the fruits. Those rejected because of fruit fly  infestation are buried in a deep hole.  The lack of good storage facilities at the farm level was also a major challenge that compelled  54 percent of farmers to sell their mangoes on the day of harvesting. Others (46%) kept them under a  makeshift shed to minimize sunburn, loss of moisture and accumulation of dust for a few days as  they waited to sell. In addition, most access roads to farms are passable only during the dry seasons  of the year but if there are heavy rains during the harvesting period, accessibility is impeded thus  contributing to post-harvest losses and a deterioration of quality leading to low selling prices. When  farmers were asked to rank the attributes that buyers considered as the most important when  selecting mangoes for purchase, 96 percent ranked fruit size first, followed closely by quality (92%),  colour as a maturity indicator (80%) and mango variety (42%). These results reveal the importance  of quality as a key attribute of marketable fruit. It is a compound attribute that refers to the lack of  external or internal damage or injury caused by insect pests, diseases, birds or mechanical damage.",The model was estimated using data collected from 240 mango growing farmers selected using multistage and proportionate to size random sampling procedures.,Survey,MUCHIRI CAROLINE MUGURE; MSc Thesis_Caroline Muchiri.pdf,MUCHIRI CAROLINE MUGURE; MSc Thesis_Caroline Muchiri.pdf,MUCHIRI CAROLINE MUGURE; MSc Thesis_Caroline Muchiri.pdf

Quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur  in the field (15%); during processing (13e20%), and during storage (15e25%). The main storage pests  responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), grain weevils (Sitophilus  granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in  weather (40%), field damage (33%), and storage pests (16%) as the three most important factors causing  poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. However, survey results suggest that the farmers’ poor  knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the food losses. 77% of the  surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41% received food aid during the previous  year.

Crop losses occur during pre-harvest drying on the field were  caused by wild animals, birds and rodents. In worst cases, up to 32%  of maize-on-cobs could be lost to birds, monkeys, other rodents  before harvest, and through qualitative spoilage by mould and  fungi which could be extensive in wet conditions. Similar qualitative loss through aflatoxin contamination of maize and cassava in  Tanzania and Congo had been reported (Manjula et al., 2009). In  terms of proportion of matured crops, 15% was estimated as preharvest field loss for most grain and legume crops. The farmers  expressed their inability and skills to effectively prevent or control  field losses by pests and rodents. An estimated 1.5% of the maize,  millet, sorghum and groundnut outputs were estimated to be lost  during harvesting. Losses during transportation of the crops by  head-loads, on bicycles and other means were 2.5%. This compares  with 2.25% losses recorded during transportation of rice from the  field to the store and 1% from the store to the market for maize in  Madagascar (Hodges, 2012). An estimated loss of 13.4% for maize  (P ¼ 0.009), 20% for millet and sunflower, 18% for groundnut, 10% for  pigeon pea, 6% for sorghum and 5% for sesame occur when manual  methods of processing were used (Table 4). The losses were in form  of mechanical damage such as breakage, puncture, compression,  rupture, dent bruises, or spillages of the crops.",4    Table 4  Percentage losses during manual processing practices,Survey,"Adebayo B.
